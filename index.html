                <h3>Problem solving</h3>
                <p> I started problem solving from my schooling time .Problem-solving skills are important in every career at every level. As a result, effective problem solving may also require industry or job-specific technical skills. For example, a registered nurse will need active listening and communication skills when interacting with patients but will also need effective technical knowledge related to diseases and medications. In many cases, a nurse will need to know when to consult a doctor regarding a patientâ€™s medical needs as part of the solution.</p>
